## Idea behind Pytorch

1 important keyword here is another deep learning frameworks construct a STATIC DATAFLOW GRAPH. <br>

so let see one by one of the word from "STATIC DATAFLOW GRAPH". <br>

- STATIC : it means that the structure of the graph is defined and does not change during the execution of the program.
- DATAFLOW : refers to the way data moves and flows through the computational graph during the execution of a program. Each node in the graph represents an operation, and the **edges** between **nodes** represent the flow of data from one operation to another.
- GRAPH : refers to a computational graph or a directed acyclic graph (DAG). It is a representation of the mathematical operations and dependencies between them in a machine learning model <br>
